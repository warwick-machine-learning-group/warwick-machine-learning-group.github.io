    "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of globally optimizing a variable of interest that is part of a causal model in which a sequence of interventions can be performed. This problem arises in biology, operational research, communications and, more generally, in all fields where the goal is to optimize an output metric of a system of interconnected nodes. Our approach combines ideas from causal inference, uncertainty quantification and sequential decision making. In particular, it generalizes Bayesian optimization, which treats the input variables of the objective function as independent, to scenarios where causal information is available. We show how knowing the causal graph significantly improves the ability to reason about optimal decision making strategies decreasing the optimization cost while avoiding suboptimal solutions. We propose a new algorithm called Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO). CBO automatically balances two trade-offs: the classical exploration-exploitation and the new observation-intervention, which emerges when combining real interventional data with the estimated intervention effects computed via do-calculus. We demonstrate the practical benefits of this method in a synthetic setting and in two real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Scalable algorithms to solve optimization and regression tasks even approximately, are needed to work with large datasets. In this paper we study efficient techniques from matrix sketching to solve a variety of convex constrained regression problems. We adopt “Iterative Hessian Sketching” (IHS) and show that the fast CountSketch and sparse Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transforms yield state-of-the-art accuracy guarantees under IHS, while dramatically improving the time cost. As a result, we obtain significantly faster algorithms for constrained regression, for both sparse and dense inputs. Our empirical results show that we can summarize data roughly 100x faster for sparse data, and, surprisingly, 10x faster on dense data! Consequently, solutions accurate to within machine precision of the optimal solution can be found much faster than the previous state of the art.",

Applications for these statistics range from finding correlations in the data to fitting sophisticated prediction models. In this paper, we provide a set of algorithms for materializing marginal statistics under the strong model of local differential privacy. We prove the first tight theoretical bounds on the accuracy of marginals compiled under each approach, perform empirical evaluation to confirm these bounds, and evaluate them for tasks such as modeling and correlation testing. Our results show that releasing information based on (local) Fourier transformations of the input is preferable to alternatives based directly on (local) marginals.",

While systems that could support these tasks are emerging, the need to scale to distributed, streaming data requires new models and algorithms. In this setting, as well as computational scalability and model accuracy, we also need to minimize the amount of communication between distributed processors, which is the chief component of latency.We study Bayesian networks, the workhorse of graphical models, and present a communication-efficient method for continuously learning and maintaining a Bayesian network model over data that is arriving as a distributed stream partitioned across multiple processors. We show a strategy for maintaining model parameters that leads to an exponential reduction in communication when compared with baseline approaches to maintain the exact MLE (maximum likelihood estimation). Meanwhile, our strategy provides similar prediction errors for the target distribution and for classification tasks.",

Our verification protocols are based on defining “proofs” which are easy to create and check. These add only a small overhead to reporting the result of the computation itself. We build up a series of protocols for elementary statistical methods, to create more complex protocols for Ordinary Least Squares, Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis.

    "abstract": "Concern about how to aggregate sensitive user data without compromising individual privacy is a major barrier to greater availability of data. The model of differential privacy has emerged as an accepted model to release sensitive information while giving a statistical guarantee for privacy. Many different algorithms are possible to address different target functions. We focus on the core problem of count queries, and seek to design <i>mechanisms</i><i>mechanisms</i>mechanisms to release data associated with a group of $n$ individuals.Prior work has focused on designing mechanisms by raw optimization of a loss function, without regard to the consequences on the results. This can leads to mechanisms with undesirable properties, such as never reporting some outputs (gaps), and overreporting others (spikes). We tame these pathological behaviors by introducing a set of desirable properties that mechanisms can obey. Any combination of these can be satisfied by solving a linear program (LP) which minimizes a cost function, with constraints enforcing the properties. We focus on a particular cost function, and provide explicit constructions that are optimal for certain combinations of properties, and show a closed form for their cost. In the end, there are only a handful of distinct optimal mechanisms to choose between: one is the well-known (truncated) geometric mechanism; the second a novel mechanism that we introduce here, and the remainder are found as the solution to particular LPs. These all avoid the bad behaviors we identify. We demonstrate in a set of experiments on real and synthetic data which is preferable in practice, for different combinations of data distributions, constraints, and privacy parameters.",

Prior work on this topic has focused primarily on the graph structure in isolation, and has not provided ways to handle richer graphs with correlated attributes.We introduce an approach to release such graphs under the strong guarantee of differential privacy. We adapt existing graph models, and introduce a new one, and show how to augment them with meaningful privacy. This provides a complete workflow, where the input is a sensitive graph, and the output is a realistic synthetic graph. Our experimental study demonstrates that our process produces useful, accurate attributed graphs.",

    "abstract": "Do you ever feel overwhelmed by a constant stream of information? It can seem like there is a barrage of new email and text messages arriving, phone calls, articles to read, and knocks on the door. Putting these pieces together to keep track of what’s important can be a real challenge.The same information overload is of concern in many computational settings. For example, telecommunications companies want to keep track of the activity on their network, to identify the overall network health, and spot anomalies or changes in behavior. Yet, the scale of events occurring is huge: many millions of network events per hour, per network element. And while new technologies allow the scale and granularity of events being monitored to increase by orders of magnitude, the capacity of computing elements to make sense of these (processors, memory and disks) is barely increasing. Even on a small scale, the amount of information may be too large to store in an impoverished setting (say, an embedded device), or be too big to conveniently keep in fast storage.In response to this challenge, the model of streaming data processing has grown in popularity. In this setting, the aim is no longer to capture, store and index every minute event, but rather to quickly process each observation to create some summary of the current state. Following its processing, an event is dropped, and is no longer accessible. The summary that is retained is often referred to as sketch of the data. Coping with the vast scale of information means making a number of compromises: the description of the world is approximate, rather than exact; the nature of queries to be answered must be decided in advance, rather than after the fact; and some questions are now insoluble. However, the ability to process vast quantities of data at blinding speeds with modest resources can more than make up for these limitations. As a consequence, streaming methods have been adopted in a number of domains, starting with telecommunications, but spreading to search engines, social networks, finance, and time-series analysis. These ideas are also finding application in areas where traditional approaches are applicable, but the rough and ready sketching approach is more cost-effective. Successful applications of sketching involve a mixture of algorithmic tricks, systems know-how, and mathematical insight, and have led to new research contributions in each of these areas.In this article, we introduce the ideas behind, and applications, of sketching, with a focus on the algorithmic innovations. That is, we describe some algorithmic developments in the abstract, and then indicate the subsequent steps needed to put them into practice, with examples. We will see four novel algorithmic ideas, and discuss some emerging areas.",

    "abstract": "We generalize the log Gaussian Cox process (LGCP) framework to model multiple correlated point data jointly. The observations are treated as realizations of multiple LGCPs, whose log intensities are given by linear combinations of latent functions drawn from Gaussian process priors. The combination coefficients are also drawn from Gaussian processes and can incorporate additional dependencies. We derive closed-form expressions for the moments of the intensity functions and develop an efficient variational inference algorithm that is orders of magnitude faster than competing deterministic and stochastic approximations of multivariate LGCP, coregionalization models, and multi-task permanental processes. Our approach outperforms these benchmarks in multiple problems, offering the current state of the art in modeling multivariate point processes.",

The resulting inference procedure is doubly robust for both the predictive and the changepoint (CP) posterior, with linear time and constant space complexity. We provide a construction for exponential models and demonstrate it on the Bayesian Linear Regression model. In so doing, we make two additional contributions: Firstly, we make GBI scalable using Structural Variational approximations that are exact as $\\beta \\to 0$. Secondly, we give a principled way of choosing the divergence parameter $\\beta$ by minimizing expected predictive loss on-line. We offer the state of the art and improve the False Discovery Rate of CPs by more than 80",

We propose spatially structured Vector Autoregressions (VARs) for modelling the process between changepoints (CPs) and give an upper bound on the approximation error of such models. The resulting algorithm performs prediction, model selection and CP detection on-line. Its time complexity is linear and its space complexity constant, and thus it is two orders of magnitudes faster than its closest competitor.

General techniques for the ancestral reconstruction of function-valued traits have recently been proposed. A full implementation of phylogenetic Gaussian processes for the ancestral reconstruction of function-valued traits representing bat echolocation calls is presented here. A phylogenetic signal was found in the data and ancestral reconstruction performed. This promising preliminary analysis paves the way for more realistic models for the evolution of echolocation in bats.",
