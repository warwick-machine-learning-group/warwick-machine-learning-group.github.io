# Warwick Machine Learning Reading Group

Our reading group takes place biweekly during term time between 3 and 4pm on Thursdays, and is currently hosted on Microsoft Teams. This usually consists of short talks on a broad range of Machine Learning topics. 

To sign up to the mailing list please visit the webpage https://listserv.csv.warwick.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/wmlg-reading-group.
